# Drum Kit  

This Drum Kit project is an interactive web application that simulates a virtual drum set. Each button represents a musical instrument and displays its image. When clicked, the corresponding sound of the instrument is played, offering an engaging and realistic drumming experience.  

### Features  
- Developed using HTML, CSS, and React.js for a dynamic and visually appealing interface.  
- Implements DOM manipulation for seamless interactivity.  
- Includes authentic musical tones for each instrument displayed on the buttons.  

This project is a fun way to explore music and create beats with just a few clicks. Dive in and make some noise!
